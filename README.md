# Sentiment-analysis

The task was to build a Node.js sentiment analysis program that will use the demo API on apidemo.theysay.io to analyze text that you pass in on the command line as an additional argument and print out the "mood" of the text, including:

- whether it is positive, negative or neutral
- what percentage of each the text is
- what kind of confidence rating it has

## Update
As of recently, the TheySay sentiment analysis API, accessible through apidemo.theysay.io, appears to be offline or retired.
